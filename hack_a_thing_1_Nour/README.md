**Short description of what you attempted to build**:
  - I attempted to build a game using Unity. I followed a tutorial that meant to show me how to design a world, add a character to it, add some form of damage, and some form of recovery, and some form of way to track health. 
  
**Who did what (if you worked with someone else)**:
  - I worked on my own.
  
**What you learned**:
 - I learned a ton about the amount of detail that goes into game design and implementation. I learned about the physics that go in to and the different settings that do similar functions.
 
**What didnâ€™t work**:
 - I had my colliders working initially. Colliders are objects or areas that the main character cannot padd through. Instead it collides with them. At some point in my tutorial, some of my colliders stopped working and I could not figure out why.
 - I am a learn by do/hear/watch kind of person, so reading the tutorial in text was a bit tedious and not as productive as I anticipated.
